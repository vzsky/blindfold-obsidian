# Blindfold for Obsidian

Blindfold aims to blind unneccessary parts of text away from the main screen by putting it in a *normally folded* section. 
The text could be toggle up using a button. I intend to use this to hide away ugly mathematic proofs, so this support latex.

thanks for [spoiler-block](https://github.com/AllJavi/spoiler-block-obsidian) for code sample.
