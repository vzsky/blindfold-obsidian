# Blindfold for Obsidian

*hidden most of the time, but always there when you need it*

Blindfold aims to blind unneccessary parts of text away from the main screen by putting it in a *normally folded* section. 
The text could be toggle up using a button. I intend to use this to hide away ugly mathematic proofs, so this support latex.

# Installation

This is blindfold normally. The buttons "click to reveal.." works as you might think. Click, to reveal.

So that the content which might takes a lot of space, and is not that important could be hidden most of the time, but always there whenever you need it.

In this case, a proof of a theorem is very important, but not insightful, hiding it most of the time makes the document more readable. However, whenever you need to see the proof to prepare for a math exam. It's always just a click.

A blindfold is construct easily by creating a codeblock, like below,

Note that you can you any obsidian function inside this codeblock, ie. <img width="724" alt="Screenshot 2566-05-23 at 23 25 50" src="https://github.com/vzsky/blindfold-obsidian/assets/20735983/32045b73-d53d-44b9-9f0d-6fb653fb4c45">
creates this
